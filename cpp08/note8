This module focuses on how to work with containers, 
template programming, iterators, and algorithms in C++â€”essentially 
teaching you to use the Standard Template Library (STL) 



A container: is a class that stores multiple elements.

A templated container: uses templates to handle any data type, making it generic and reusable

An iterator: is like a pointer used to move through a container's elements.



Examples in STL:

std::vector<T>

std::list<T>

std::deque<T>

std::map<Key, Value>

STL provides ready-to-use algorithms to manipulate containers using iterators:

std::find()

std::sort()

std::count()

begin()

std::copy()
