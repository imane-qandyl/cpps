 C++ Module 05, the main focus is on inheritance, polymorphism, 
 and understanding how to structure classes using virtual functions.

i build a system like:

Bureaucrat class with a grade.

Form class that needs signing by a bureaucrat of a certain grade.

If the grade is too low â†’ throw an exception.


Inheritance :
 Allows one class (the child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another((the parent or base class)).


Polymorphism
Enables using base class pointers or references to call derived class methods.
Animal* a = new Cat();
a->speak();  // Meow (not Animal speaks)

Virtual Functions:

When you use inheritance, sometimes you want the derived class to have its own version of a method.
You declare the method as virtual in the base class so that C++ knows to use the derived version when appropriate.


pure virtual function:

is a function declared in the base class that must be implemented in derived classes
