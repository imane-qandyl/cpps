the main topic is Templates. This module focuses 
on writing generic and reusable code, so your classes
and functions can work with any type, not just one specific type like int or string.



Templates: allow writing one function that works with any data type.

Concept	Why?

Function Templates:	One function, all types (swap, min, max)

Class Templates:	One class, all types (like a Box or a simple Array class)
