you learn about casting and type conversions in C++. This is essential 
when converting between different types (like float to int, or char to double), 
while understanding how C++ handles implicit and explicit conversions.

In cpp06, I learned about the four C++ casting operators and their use cases. I built a ScalarConverter that takes a string and attempts to convert it into char, int, float, and double, handling impossible conversions or special floating-point values. I used standard functions like std::stoi and explicit casts like static_cast for safe type conversions, respecting C++ best practices.


I use functions like std::stoi, std::stod, and casting operators to handle these conversions

static_cast	:Used for normal type conversions (e.g. float to int)

dynamic_cast	:Used for safe downcasting (Base* to Derived*)

const_cast	:Used to remove or add const

reinterpret_cast :like pointer type changes (int* to char*)
